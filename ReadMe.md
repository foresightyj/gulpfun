Fun with Gulp
=============

This is a project simply demonstrates most used functionalities of gulp in a frontend dev scenario.

# dependencies

* `npm config set python python2.7`
* `npm config set msvs_version 2015 --global`

Check out [Node Canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) for windows specific instructions for installing node canvas which is a dependency of gulp-spritesmith.

[Also here](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/issues/619)

Note that it is [gulp.spritesmith](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp.spritesmith), not `gulp-spritesmith` which is another package but less useful.
